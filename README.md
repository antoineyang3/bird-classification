# bird-classification

This repository presents my final solution for a class Kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/mva-recvis-2019) on fine-grained image classification. The goal of this competition was to design a model that had maximum test accuracy on Image ClassiÔ¨Åcation of a subset of 20 classes and 1702 images of the Birds200 dataset. I achieved 92.258% of accuracy in the public leaderboard (2nd place), and 91.436% of accuracy in the private leaderboard (2nd place).
